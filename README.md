### Installation Instructions:
1. Ensure that you have python and pip on your machine and that they are up to date.
1. From your terminal, run `pip install django`.
1. Change directory to the directory in which you want to store the server and run `git clone https://github.com/sithon512/DnD-Planner`.
1. From the newly created root directory for the server, change directory to `/DnDPlanner/`
1. From your terminal, run `python manage.py runserver`.

You should now see in your terminal that the server has started and is listening on [127.0.0.1:8000]. If you type that address into your web browser of choice, you will be able to see the server running for you.
